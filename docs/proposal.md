Implementation of Configurable SMS Notifications for iGot Karmayogi

## Summary
This project aims to develop an intuitive interface for configuring SMS templates and a system for selecting and sending personalized SMS messages to multiple users. The system will enhance user engagement by facilitating easy customization and efficient generation of SMS content.

## Project Details

### Project Overview
The project involves creating a user-friendly interface for configuring SMS templates and implementing a system to select and send these templates to multiple users. This will include dynamic content insertion to personalize the messages.

### Understanding of the Project
The key components of the project are:
1. **Configuration Interface**: A tool for setting up SMS templates with customizable options.
2. **Dynamic Content Generation**: Creating SMS content dynamically based on templates and user data.
3. **Template Selection**: Enabling the selection of specific templates when sending SMS to multiple users.

### Problems (if any)
1. **Complexity in Template Configuration**: Ensuring the interface is user-friendly.
2. **Dynamic Content Management**: Managing placeholders and dynamic content efficiently.
3. **Integration with Existing Systems**: Integrating the new functionality seamlessly with the current SMS sending process.

### Solutions

## Previous Experience/Open Source Projects
**Project Name**: Spring Social media blog API
**Project Description**: This project will be a backend for a hypothetical social media app, where we must manage our users’ accounts as well as any messages that they submit to the application. However, the functionality for this project will leverage a popular web application framework for Java known as Spring. The Spring framework allows for automatic injection and configuration of many features, including data persitence, endpoints and conventional data manipulation logic (CRUD operations).

**Project Name**: Unit Testing React Module Project: Stranger Things
**Project Description**: This module explored passing props into test components, rerendering components and using mocks to both monitor functional props and override the functionality of external modules. In this project, you will practice each of these practices in the testing of an application that displays TV show data.

Objectives
Understand how to test the effects of passing specific props into a component
Understand how to monitor the behavior of functional mock props.
Understand how and when to test using the rerender method
Learn how to mock the use an external module
